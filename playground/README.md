A Place for Experiments, Prototypes and Benchmarks.

currently contains:

- db_benchmarks - a proof of concept to stream data from the observers directly into a database
  - json-interfaces are a bottleneck
  - file-based data-collection win by far
- prototype-fastapi - works for offering a user-interface
- shepherd-webserver - first dummy api for shepherd.cfaed.tu-dresden.de to get domain validated and released to the world
